<p>A Manufacturing Readiness Assessment may be initiated at any stage of the acquisition program, most often by the Program Manager. A manufacturer or contractor may also conduct their own assessments, but it is ultimately the Program Manager’s responsibility to ensure the appropriate manufacturing readiness level has been reached by a given milestone in the program. The Program Manager will identify the program’s need for the assessment, which begins the process.</p>

<p>In addition to determining the need, the site for the evaluation must also be determined.</p>

<p>I want to verify that the manufacturing capabilities are in place to ensure the adequate and timely production of the system I’m overseeing. Consequently, I’ve identified the need to conduct a Manufacturing Readiness Assessment. Now, I need to determine where the assessment will take place.</p>

<p>There are five triggers that determine a program’s need for a Manufacturing Readiness Assessment. They include an approaching milestone review; an Aeronautical Armament Center mandate; a request by the Program Executive Officer, Office of the Secretary of Defense, or similar party; good business sense; or as indicated by Department of Defense criteria.</p>

<p>I’ve been told that it is a good business practice to incorporate the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment process into the program as early as possible. I figure that prior to Milestone A is early enough. That way, I can build a baseline for subsequent assessments.</p>

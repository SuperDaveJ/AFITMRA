<p>As mentioned before, the  program office is required to prepare a Manufacturing Maturation Plan that  covers all manufacturing risk areas. The Manufacturing Maturation Plan is  created with the assistance of the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment report  and the two are delivered simultaneously.</p>
<p>Below is an outline for a Manufacturing  Maturation Plan. It includes the most essential items in planning for  manufacturing maturity. </p>

<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Arnold Jackson </p>
<p>Using the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Report, it is my  responsibility to prepare a Manufacturing Maturation Plan. In addition to the  general content of the plan, it should address details such as what prototypes  or test articles will be built, what tests will be run, how does the test  environment relate to the operational environment, what threshold performance  must be met, what manufacturing readiness level will be achieved and when will  it be achieved.</p>

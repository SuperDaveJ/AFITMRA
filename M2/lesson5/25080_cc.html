<p>Each of the manufacturing risk areas addressed in the Manufacturing  Maturation Plan will subsequently have a Mitigation Plan developed for it. This  Mitigation Plan stays in effect throughout the lifecycle of the program. </p>
<p>Mitigation Plans  should include four items: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Identification of the system, subsystem, or component. </li>
  <li>A description of the manufacturing problem. </li>
  <li>An assessment of the program impacts on cost, schedule, and technical  risks. </li>
  <li>Development of alternative solutions. </li>
</ul>

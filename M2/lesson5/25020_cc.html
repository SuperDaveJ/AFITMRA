<p>With the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment  completed, it is now time to combine the information gathered by the assessors  and formally document it. However, between the end of the assessment and the  submission of the final report, there are several steps that you will need to  take.</p>

<p>The process following the completion of the  Manufacturing Readiness Assessment was a stressful one, to say the least.  First, we found that we were missing some data; however, we were luckily able  to fix that oversight in short order. Then, I gathered the team back together  to discuss the assessment results. There was some interesting discussion about  the results and plans, but we managed to achieve a consensus. We shared the  results with the contractor and set about documenting the results in the  Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Report.</p>

The report will be provided to Department of Defense for use in the  milestone decision process at least one month prior to the scheduled milestone  review.</p>

<p>Arnold, here is the Manufacturing Readiness  Assessment Report. I made sure to double check that the team and I covered  everything that needed to be covered.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Arnold Jackson </p>
<p>Thank you so much, Janet. Looks like we should  have plenty of time to review the report in regards to the milestone decision.  Thanks again for your hard work and timeliness.</p>

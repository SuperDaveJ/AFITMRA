<p>It is not possible to  visit every supplier of every material, component, and assembly for every  assessment. For those elements that will not be assessed on-site, a plan must  be made to complete an assessment in another way. This plan is known as a Supplier  Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Plan.</p>

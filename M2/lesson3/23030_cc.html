<p>To be effective in  planning the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment, team members from outside the  program need to familiarize themselves with the program.</p>
<p>The Program Manager collects and provides the necessary program data and  documentation to the team so that it is in place prior to the assessment and  ready to review.</p>
<p>After the data and documentation is provided to the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment  Team, the team convenes at Program Management Office for briefings. If  necessary, a video teleconference or telecom may be substituted for a  face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>Select the bulleted items for additional information, and then select the MRA in Action icon to view the next segment of the  Manufacturing Readiness Assessment process scenario.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Arnold Jackson </p>
<p>Iâ€™ve  collected some information that we need to go over for the purpose of the Manufacturing  Readiness Assessment. The information includes the objectives and status of the  program, Critical Technology Elements, configuration of hardware, and roles and  locations of key contractors and suppliers. This information coupled with some  contractor provided information, will give you a good idea of what needs to be  accomplished.</p>

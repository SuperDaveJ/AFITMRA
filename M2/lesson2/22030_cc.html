<p>In addition to  identifying the assessment team and designating a Team Lead, the Defense  Contract Management Agency should be contacted in order to gather information  on the contractor’s performance. They will also act as the liaison between the  Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Team and the contractor or contractors.</p>
<p>The Team Lead and the MRA Team both have important planning activities  to perform for the assessment.</p>
<p>Select Team Lead and MRA Team for additional  information, and then select the MRA in Action icon to view the next segment of the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment process  scenario. </p>

<p>Okay team, we’ve prepared a good deal for this day and  to reiterate, our goal is to ensure that the manufacturing processes for this  particular contractor meet the required readiness level for the program.</p>
<p>I’m  responsible for conducting this assessment, so if any issues arise, please let  me know. I’ll get in touch with our DCMA liaison right away if we need help in  getting the issues resolved. </p>

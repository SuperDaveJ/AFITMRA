  <p>Text popups for the 9 selectable MSOB questions on  the left side of the page display on the right side of the page in a framed  text area.</p>
  <p><strong>What are the steps associated with performing the  assessment?</strong></p>
  <p>Initial  meetings at the contractor </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are  two parts to the initial meetings at the contractor site. First, the contractor  leads a welcome to the facility, a review of the agenda, and conducts an  orientation of the facility. He/she will also introduce the assessment team and  the contractor personnel. </p>
    <p>The second  part of the initial meetings is led by the MRA team leader. She/he briefs the  contractor by explaining the purpose of the MRA, how the results will be used,  the objectives of the assessment process (any risk issues), and sets  expectations for the assessment. </p>
    <p>The  contractor then briefs the MRA team by highlighting the responsibilities of any  MRA participants who are employed by the contractor, detailing any  self-assessment results, and providing detailed responses to any questions that  were in the orientation package. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Shop floor  visits. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Shop floor  visits are used to look for physical evidence that the self-assessment is  valid, true, or accurate. The assessment team members will observe actual  processes and procedures as they take place on the shop floor. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>One-on-one or  small group discussions between assessment team members and contractor SMEs. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You will  remember in step three the MRA team defined the objectives and scope for the  MRA. The team prepared themselves by reviewing existing briefing materials,  contracts, and progress reports. They made sure they understood the purpose of  the MRA, the objectives and status of the program, any Critical Technology  Elements, configuration of hardware, and roles and locations of key contractors  and suppliers.</p>
    <p>During the  assessment team members engage in one-on-one or small group discussions with  contractor SMEs. These discussions are focused on the key areas determined in  step three and give team members a different level of understanding beyond the  floor visits. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Private meeting  of MRA team. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>After the  on-site assessment, but before they leave, the MRA team prepares feedback and  identifies any action items from the MRA. This feedback will cover two areas.  It will: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate  any areas of excellence </li>
      <li>Validate  any areas of shortfall </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also during  this meeting, the MRA team will utilize the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment  Tool (MRAT), discuss the initial assessment of the current MRL, the key  strengths / risks / issues, any key missing data, and any proposed action  items. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Out Briefing </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The last  item in the on-site assessment is the out briefing. During this time the MRA  team meets with the contractor. The MRA report has yet to be finalized, but the  team gives a preliminary report that includes key findings to the contractor. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the definition of a MRL?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manufacturing  Readiness Levels are a common language and standard for assessing the  manufacturing maturity of a technology or product and the plans for its future  maturation. </li>
    <li>Manufacturing  Readiness Levels are a common language and standard for understanding the level  of manufacturing risk in the production of a weapon system or the transition  technology to a weapon system application. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What is the importance of MRLs?</strong></p>
  <p>MRLs reduce: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical  problems </li>
    <li>Cost  increases </li>
    <li>Schedule  slippage </li>
  </ul>
  <p>MRLs assure: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mature  technology </li>
    <li>Stable  product design </li>
    <li>Mature  production processes </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What is the importance of having MRLs in contract  language?</strong></p>
  <p>MRLs in  Contract Language: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assist  the evaluation process </li>
    <li>State  measurable, specific objectives </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What are the 3 MRL production environments?</strong></p>
  <p>Production  Relevant Environment </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Normally  found during MRL 5 and 6. Contains the key elements of production realism not  normally found in the laboratory environment. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Production  Representative Environment </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Normally  found during MRL 7. Contains most of the key elements that will be present on  the shop floor production areas when low rate production takes place. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Pilot Line  Environment </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Normally  found during MRL 8. Contains all of the key elements required to produce  production configuration items, subsystems or systems that meet design  requirements in low rate production. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the importance of knowing the TRLs during an MRA?</strong></p>
  <p>Technology  Readiness Levels provide significant insights into potential program problems  and risks with technology maturity and design stability. </p>
  <p>They provide  a systematic metric / measurement system to assess the maturity of a particular  technology and allow a consistent comparison of maturity between different  types of technology. Once the technology, and any accompanying issues, has been  identified we can determine if the manufacturing processes needed to produce it  are in place and are mature. </p>
  <p><strong>What is the difference between the 10 MRLs?</strong></p>
  <p>MRL 1 -  Manufacturing Feasibility Assessed </p>
  <p>MRL 2 -  Manufacturing Concepts Defined </p>
  <p>MRL 3 -  Manufacturing Concepts Developed </p>
  <p>MRL 4 -  Capability to produce the technology in a laboratory environment </p>
  <p>MRL 5 -  Capability to produce prototype components in a production relevant environment </p>
  <p>MRL 6 -  Capability to produce a prototype system or subsystem in a production relevant  environment </p>
  <p>MRL 7 -  Capability to produce systems, subsystems or components in a production  representative environment </p>
  <p>MRL 8 - Pilot  line capability demonstrated, Low Rate Initial Production begins </p>
  <p>MRL 9 - Low  rate production demonstrated, Capability in place to begin Full Rate Production </p>
  <p>MRL 10 - Full  Rate Production demonstrated and lean production practices in place </p>
  <p><strong>What are the 9 threads of evaluation criteria?</strong></p>
  <p>Technology  and the Industrial Base </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This thread  requires an analysis of the capability of the national technology and  industrial base to support the design, development, production, operation,  uninterrupted maintenance support, and eventual disposal (environmental  impacts) of the system. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Design </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This thread  requires an understanding of the maturity and stability of the evolving system  design as well as any related impact on manufacturing readiness. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Materials</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  requirement for this thread is an analysis of the risks associated with  materials (including basic / raw materials, components, semi-finished parts,  and subassemblies).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Cost and  Funding</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This thread  requires an analysis to be sure the funding is adequate to achieve target  manufacturing maturity levels. It also examines the risk associated with  reaching manufacturing cost targets. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Process  Capability and Control</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  requirements for this thread are a risk analysis of the manufacturing  processes, to ensure they are able to reflect the design intent (repeatability  and affordability) for key characteristics. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Quality  Management</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This thread  requires an analysis of the risks and management efforts to control quality and  to foster continuous improvement.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Manufacturing  Personnel</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  requirements for this thread are an assessment of the required skills and  availability in necessary numbers of personnel to support the manufacturing  effort.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Facilities</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The  requirements for this thread include an analysis of the capabilities and  capacity of key manufacturing facilities (prime, subcontractor, supplier,  vendor, and maintenance / repair).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Manufacturing  Management</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This thread  requires an analysis of the orchestration of all elements needed to translate  the design into an integrated and fielded system (meeting Program goals for  affordability and availability).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What are the phases of the MRAT tool?</strong></p>
  <p>Plan /  Customize / Set-up</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The tool’s  setup screen is used to input the information used by MRAT for creating  tailored folders and assessment files for a specific MRA. The team Lead  completes the initial MRAT set-up worksheet and assigns threads / questions to  evaluators and the contractor.</p>
    <p>The MRAT  creates a folder with a customized tool and sub-folder with evaluator and  contractor workbooks. <strong> </strong><br />
      Individual Evaluation</p>
    <p>The Team  Lead disseminates the workbooks to the evaluators and contractor, who answer  their assigned questions. When complete, the evaluators and contractor return  the workbooks to the Team Lead who then saves them in the evaluator sub-folder.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Consensus</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Team  Lead imports the individual scores from the workbooks into the customized tool  and completes the scores on the consensus sheet. <strong> </strong><br />
      The MRA Team  evaluates the answers to the questions and come to a final consensus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Reporting</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Team Lead  produces and distributes the MRA MRAT report. The MRAT can be used to find out  what needs to be addressed to raise the MRL value.</p>

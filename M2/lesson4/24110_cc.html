<p>Technology  Readiness Levels are not interchangeable with Manufacturing Readiness Levels.  However, it is important to know how they fit together. For instance, a  critical technology might be very mature, yet the manufacturing processes  needed to produce it may be very immature.</p>

<p>Our  understanding of the technology readiness levels gives us insight into  potential problems and risks regarding technology maturity and design stability  that we wouldn’t normally have. Additionally, by knowing the readiness of a  system’s technology elements, we can determine what manufacturing processes are  needed to produce it and whether or not they are in place.</p>

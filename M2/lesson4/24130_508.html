<p>Text popups for the 10 selectable areas of the MRL  thermometer on the left side of the page display on the right side of the page  in a framed text area. </p>
<p><strong>MRL 1</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturing  Feasibility Assessed</p>
<p>This is the  lowest level of manufacturing readiness. The focus is on a high-level  assessment of feasibility and of manufacturing shortfalls. Basic manufacturing  principles are defined and observed, and basic research is begun in the form of  studies to identify producibility and material solutions.</p>
<p><strong>MRL 2</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturing  Concepts Defined</p>
<p>This level is  characterized by the development of new manufacturing approaches or  capabilities. Applied Research translates basic research into solutions for  broadly defined military needs. A demonstration of the feasibility for  producing a prototype product / component with very little support / data  available begins. Typically this level of readiness is associated with Applied  Research in the Science &amp; Technology environment and includes  identification and study of material and process approaches, including modeling  and simulation.</p>
<p><strong>MRL 3</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturing  Concepts Developed</p>
<p>The first real  demonstrations of the manufacturing concepts now begin. This level of readiness  is typical of technologies in the Science &amp; Technology funding categories  of 6.2 and 6.3.  Within these levels,  identification of current manufacturing concepts, or producibility, has  occurred and is based on laboratory studies. Materials have been characterized  for manufacturability and availability, but further evaluation and  demonstration is required. Models that may possess limited functionality have  been developed in a lab environment.</p>
<p><strong>MRL 4</strong></p>
<p>Capability to  produce the technology in a laboratory environment</p>
<p>This level of readiness is typical for Science &amp; Technology Programs  in the 6.2 and 6.3 Advanced Development categories, and acts as an exit  criteria for the Material solution Analysis phase approaching a Milestone A  decision. Technologies should have matured to at least TRL 4. This level  indicates that the technologies are ready for the Technology Development phase  of acquisition. At this point required investments, such as manufacturing  technology development, have been identified; processes to ensure  manufacturability, producibility and quality are in place; manufacturing risks  have been identified for prototype build, and manufacturing cost drivers have  been identified. Producibility assessments for design concepts have been  completed. Key design performance parameters have been identified as well as  any special needs for tooling, facilities, material handling and skills. </p>
<p><strong>MRL 5</strong></p>
<p>Capability to  produce prototype components in a production relevant environment</p>
<p>This level of  maturity is typical of the mid-point in the Technology Development phase of  acquisition. In the case of key technologies, it is near the mid-point of an  ATD program. Technologies should have matured to at least TRL 5. The Industrial  Base has been assessed to identify potential manufacturing sources. A  manufacturing strategy has been refined and integrated with the Risk Management  Plan. Identification of enabling / critical technologies and components is  complete. Prototype materials, tooling and test equipment, as well as personnel  skills have been demonstrated on components in a production relevant environment,  but many manufacturing processes and procedures are still in development.  Manufacturing technology development efforts have been initiated, or are  ongoing. Producibility assessments of key technologies and components are  ongoing. A cost model has been constructed which is based upon a detailed  end-to-end value stream map.</p>
<p><strong>MRL 6</strong></p>
<p>Capability to  produce a prototype system or subsystem in a production relevant environment</p>
<p>This MRL is associated with readiness for a MS B decision to initiate an  acquisition program by entering into the Engineering &amp; Manufacturing  Development phase of acquisition. Technologies should have matured to at least  TRL 6. It is normally seen as the level of manufacturing readiness that denotes  completion of Science &amp; Technology  development and acceptance into a baseline  system design. An initial manufacturing approach has been developed. The  majority of manufacturing processes have been defined and characterized, but  there are still significant engineering and / or design changes. However,  preliminary design of critical components has been completed so that  producibility assessments of key technologies can be complete. Prototype  materials, tooling and test equipment, as well as personnel skills, have been  demonstrated on systems and / or subsystems in a production relevant  environment. A detailed cost analysis should include design trades and  allocated cost targets. Producibility considerations have shaped system  development plans. The Industrial Capabilities Assessment (ICA) for MS B has  been completed and long lead and key supply chain elements have been  identified. </p>
<p><strong>MRL 7</strong></p>
<p>Capability to  produce systems, subsystems or components in a production representative  environment</p>
<p>This level of  manufacturing readiness is typical for the mid-point of the Engineering &amp;  Manufacturing Development Phase leading to the Post-CDR Assessment.  Technologies should be maturing to at least TRL 7. System detailed design  activity is underway. Material specifications have been approved and materials are  available to meet the planned pilot line build schedule. Manufacturing  processes and procedures have been demonstrated in a production representative  environment. Detailed producibility trade studies and risk assessments are  underway. The cost model has been updated with detailed designs, rolled up to  system level, and tracked against allocated targets. Unit cost reduction  efforts have been prioritized and are underway. Supply chain and supplier  quality assurance elements have been assessed, and long lead procurement plans  are in place. Production tooling and test equipment design and development have  been initiated.</p>
<p><strong>MRL 8</strong></p>
<p>Pilot line  capability demonstrated, Low Rate Initial Production begins</p>
<p>This level is  associated with readiness for a MS C decision, and entry into Low Rate Initial  Production. Technologies should have matured to at least TRL 7. Detailed system  design is essentially complete and sufficiently stable to enter low rate  production. All materials are available to meet the planned low rate production  schedule. Manufacturing and quality processes and procedures have been proven  in a pilot line environment. Processes are under control such that any known  producibility risks pose no significant risk for low rate production. There is  an Engineering Cost Model driven by the stable detailed design, and this cost  model has been validated. The Industrial Capability Assessment for MS C has  been completed and shows that the supply chain is established and stable.  </p>
<p><strong>MRL 9</strong></p>
<p>Low rate  production demonstrated, Capability in place to begin Full Rate Production</p>
<p>The system,  component, or item has been previously produced, is in production, or has  successfully achieved low rate initial production. Technologies should have  matured to at least TRL 8. This level of readiness is normally associated with  readiness for entry into Full Rate Production. During LRIP all systems  engineering / design requirements should have been met such that there are  minimal system changes. Major system design features are stable and have been  proven in test and evaluation. Materials are available to meet planned rate  production schedules. Manufacturing processes and procedures are established  and controlled in a low rate production environment to three-sigma, or some  other appropriate quality level, to meet design key characteristic tolerances.  Production risk monitoring is ongoing. LRIP cost targets have been met, with  learning curves validated. The cost model has been developed for FRP  environment, and reflects the impact of continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>MRL 10</strong></p>
<p>Full Rate  Production demonstrated and lean production practices in place<br />
  The system,  component or item is in full rate production. Technologies should have matured  to at least TRL 9. This level of manufacturing is normally associated with the  Production or Sustainment phases of the acquisition life cycle. Engineering /  design changes are few, and are generally limited to quality and cost  improvements. Systems, components or items are in full rate production and meet  all engineering, performance, quality and reliability requirements. All  materials, manufacturing processes and procedures, inspection and test  equipment are in production and controlled to six-sigma or some other  appropriate quality level. Rate production unit costs meet goals, and funding  is sufficient for production at required rates. Lean practices are  well-established, and continuous process improvements are ongoing.</p>

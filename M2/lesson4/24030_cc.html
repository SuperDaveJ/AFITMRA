<p>Previous experience from the field experts has revealed four best  practices.</p>
<p>First: Assign specific technologies, assemblies, subsystems, or  processes to individuals or sub teams. This is especially helpful when working  with larger assessments.</p>
<p>Second: Inform the contractor in advance if there are high-interest  areas where shop floor visits and / or discussions with contractor experts will  be requested.</p>
<p>Third: Seek out documentation that supports the contractor  self-assessment results. For instance, any plans, yield data, reports,  briefings, work instructions, etc.</p>
<p>And lastly: If there is any  information the contractor was unable to provide in a key area, assign an  action item to provide that information by a specific date. </p>

<p>When I sent the orientation package to the contractor,  I informed them that we would need to visit the shop floor.  After I received their self assessment back,  myself and the team gathered supporting documentation to correlate the results.  Finally, I decided that I’d break the team into three groups of two to cover  more ground in a timely manner during the assessment.</p>

<p>To this point, we’ve looked at the steps of the  assessment and the definitions associated with how we define manufacturing  readiness. We will now take a look at the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment  Tool. It is an on-line tool that is used as an aid for the team leader to help organize and  conduct an assessment. It compiles individual evaluator’s answers and helps  achieve a team consensus on MRLs. The Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Tool  has four phases. Click on each phase to learn more about it.</p>

<p>The  Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Tool has been a dream to use. All of the  team members completed their own workbooks, answering questions and providing  comments as they relate to different readiness levels and the different  threads. It was easy to compare and draw a consensual decision about the  manufacturing readiness level.</p>

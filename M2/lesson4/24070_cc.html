<p>There are no contract language requirements for a  Manufacturing Readiness Assessment, but it is suggested as a best practice. By  including Manufacturing Readiness Levels in a contract, you ensure the  evaluation process is more effective because the contract identifies the  specific measurable objectives for the assessment.</p>
<p class="popupTitle">Mr. Arnold Jackson </p>
<p>With this language in the contract, the contractor has  a clear understanding of what is expected of them and we have an idea of the  path for the program.</p>

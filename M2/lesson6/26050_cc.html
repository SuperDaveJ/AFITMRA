<p>Readiness Levels are used within the risk mitigation process to evaluate  and check on progress. Manufacturing Readiness Levels are the foundation of risk  mitigation. The purpose of the Manufacturing Readiness Level tool is to  identify manufacturing and production risk.</p>
<p>The  identification of risk allows the Project Manager to create a plan or options  to remove or reduce the risk. It also allows others to see a program's  manufacturing risk and to see what is being done about it. Identifying risk allows  for risk mitigation efforts, thereby making a program stronger and able to move  forward. If risks are ignored you have a  high potential for failure. </p>

<p>I’ll pass the information we gathered about risks to  the project manager. He’ll use it to create a mitigation plan. Manufacturing  Readiness Levels sure make this job easier. Without them, it would be much more  difficult to meet the schedule, cost, and performance requirements and deliver  the system on time.</p>

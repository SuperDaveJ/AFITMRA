<p>Obviously, the goal  of the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment is to achieve manufacturing  readiness. Effective mitigation planning depends on  the knowledge gained from all aspects of the program. Always keep in mind that  knowledge  reduces risk.</p>
<p>Mitigation Planning  includes identifying where risks exist, defining those risks, and planning so  that any potential problems caused by those risks can be avoided. Without this process, not  only will risks continue to impede the program, they will grow and cause more  problems as they proliferate. </p>

<p>We’re almost done with this Manufacturing Readiness  Assessment. The next thing we need to do is document the results of the  assessment. We’ll use the Manufacturing Readiness Levels to help us determine  where there are risks in the program, exactly what they are, and what steps  need to be taken to avoid any future problems that might pop up as a result of  those risks.</p>

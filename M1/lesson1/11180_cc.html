<p>While there  are many benefits to the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment, there are some  potential drawbacks that you need to keep in mind. Mainly, it is difficult to  get a Manufacturing Readiness Assessment into a current contract. There are  several reasons for this. </p>
<ul>
  <li>One:  A Manufacturing Readiness Assessment is perceived as using already limited  resources and unnecessary time. People don’t know where or how to get the  resources (that is, find Subject Matter Experts and people with the proper  expertise). In addition, most people feel like they are already undermanned and  finding those resources looks like an additional burden.</li>
  <li>Two:  People may not want to find out issues with their program that are currently  unknown. They don’t want to discover new or hidden issues. </li>
  <li>Three:  The question always comes up, where are the funds coming from to fix those  problems? Along those same lines of thought, there is a resistance to  Manufacturing Readiness Assessments because it may not produce an immediate  gain for the cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are  there ways to minimize the drawbacks or the extent that they proliferate? One  way to do that is to know and have a good relationship with your Procuring  Contracting Officer. He or she is a good source for Subject Matter Experts and  people with the proper expertise, as well as a good resource for funding  issues.<br />
  Another  way to minimize the drawbacks is to build a good, well-rounded team for the  MRA.</p>
<p>Remember, even though  there are drawbacks to the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment process, the  value of conducting the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment far outweighs those  drawbacks. </p>

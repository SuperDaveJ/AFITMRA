<p>Now  that you know what a Manufacturing Readiness Assessment is, let's move  into a discussion about why we perform it. What purpose does it serve? Let’s  look at that now. </p>
<p>The purpose of a Manufacturing  Readiness Assessment is to evaluate a programs’ ability to produce on-schedule  while meeting cost and performance requirements and to develop and implement  manufacturing risk mitigation plans and business strategies. This is important  because immature manufacturing development often leads to cost overruns, schedule  slippages, and performance problems. </p>
<p>To  understand this purpose, consider the 2009 Government Accountability Office Report to Congressional Committees of 47  Department of Defense programs. This study was conducted to show the effects of  moving forward in a program without having requisite knowledge at key decision  points. </p>
<p>The Government  Accountability Office followed those programs over a seven year period. Very  few of them used statistical process control data to measure the maturity of  their production processes. The study found a cost increase of 42%, with an  estimated total acquisition cost growth of $296 billion for those 47 programs  over 7 years. In addition, it found that the average schedule delay was 22  months. The conclusion of the analysis was that that one of the three key  contributors to the cost and schedule growth was not adequately understanding  and addressing Manufacturing / Quality issues during development and  production. </p>

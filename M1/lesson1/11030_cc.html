<p>Manufacturing maturity is measured  using a scale we call Manufacturing Readiness Levels or MRLs. Program managers  are expected to assess manufacturing readiness using Manufacturing Readiness  Levels early in their programs to establish a baseline. The results are then  used to create a manufacturing maturation plan to reach suitable manufacturing  readiness goals.Â </p>
<p>The Manufacturing Readiness  Level rating scale used in the Manufacturing Readiness Assessment ranges from  level one through level ten. Select each of the manufacturing readiness levels  on the chart to view its definition. </p>

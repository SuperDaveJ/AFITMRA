<p>DoDI 5000.02 does not mention manufacturing  considerations for the Material Solution Analysis Phase, but it is implied, as  failure to address manufacturing risk in the development of the Technology  Development Strategy can be a costly mistake, which can be very difficult to  recover from in later program phases.</p>
<p>During the early Material Solution Analysis  Phase, the manufacturing maturity will be determined using Manufacturing Readiness  Level 3 criteria. This will be addressed through an initial Manufacturing Readiness  Assessment within one year of the start of the phase. </p>
<p>There will be a  final Manufacturing Readiness Assessment performed prior to Milestone A. This assessment  will use Manufacturing Readiness Level 4 criteria to determine if all  manufacturing risks have been assessed at the appropriate level and that an  appropriate Manufacturing Maturity Plan is in place for the transition to the Technology  Development Phase.</p>
<p>Select the Purpose,  Definition, Description, and Key Manufacturing Considerations on the table to  reveal the MRL 4 relationships for Milestone A. </p>
